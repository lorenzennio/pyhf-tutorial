    "## p-value for discovery of a new signal\n",
    "\n",
    "In searches for new physics we want to know how significant a potential deviation from our Standard Model (SM) expectation is. We do this by a hypothesis test where we try to exclude the SM (\"background only\") hypothesis. We use a so called **p-value** $P(t_{obs}|H_0)$ for this, abstractly defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(t_{obs}|H_0) = \\int\\limits_{t_\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\infty}p(t|H_0)\\mathrm{d}t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is a test statistic (a number we calculate from our data observations) and $p(t|H_0)$ is the probability distribution for $t$ under the assumption of our **null hypothesis** $H_0$, in this case the background only hypothesis. This p-value is then typically converted into a number of standard deviations $z$, the **significance** (\"number of sigmas\") via the inverse of the cumulative standard normal distribution $\\Phi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - P)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical convention for particle physics is to speak of *evidence* when $z>3$ and of an *observation* when $z>5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we use for $t$? We want to use something that discriminates well between our null hypothesis and an **alternative hypothesis** that we have in mind. When we try to discover new physics, our null hypothesis is the absence and the alternative hypothesis the presence of a signal. We can parametrize this by a **signal strength** parameter $\\mu$. The test statistics used in almost all HEP searches use the **profile likelihood ratio**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda(\\mu) = \\frac{L(\\mu, \\hat{\\hat{\\theta}})}{L(\\hat{\\mu}, \\hat{\\theta})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ are the other parameters of our model that are not part of the test, the so called **nuisance parameters**. In contrast, the parameter that we want to test, $\\mu$, is called our **parameter of interest** (POI). The nuisance parameters include all fit parameters, like normalization factors and parameters for describing uncertainties. $L(\\mu, \\hat{\\hat{\\theta}})$ is the Likelihood function, maximized under the condition that our parameter of interest takes the value $\\mu$ and $L(\\hat{\\mu}, \\hat{\\theta})$ is the unconditionally maximized Likelihood. So roughly speaking, we are calculating the fraction of the maximum possible likelihood that we can get under our test condition. If it is high, that speaks for our hypothesis, if it is low, against. The test statistic $t_\\mu$ is then defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t_\\mu = -2\\ln\\lambda(\\mu)$$\n",

    "giving us a test statistic where **high values speak against the null hypothesis**.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All that's left now is to know the distribution of $p(t_\\mu|H_0)$. [Wilk's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilks%27_theorem) tells us that the distribution of $t_\\mu$ is asymptotically (for large sample sizes) a chi-square distribution. The asymptotic limit often matches quite well even for fairly small sample sizes, but it should be kept in mind this is an approximation. Alternatively, one can evaluate $p(t_\\mu|H_0)$ by Monte Carlo sampling (\"toys\").\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on test statistics for different cases and the asymptotic distributions for all different variants can be found in the paper \"Asymptotic formulae for likelihood-based tests of new physics\" ([arXiv:1007.1727](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1727))."

    "Now, sadly, not all searches find evidence for new physics. What we still can do in such a case is to try exclude models by rejecting the hypothesis of a signal being present. That usually means we test against $\\mu=1$ or some other value $>0$. For establishing an upper limit on the strength parameter $\\mu$, we use a slightly modified version of test statistic,\n",

    "\n",
    "Just a qualitative explanation of why we use $CL_s$ instead of the p-value: We want to avoid excluding signals in cases where we don't have sensitivity, but observe an *underfluctuation* of the data. In these cases $P(q_{obs}|s+b)$ and $P(q_{obs}|b)$ will be very similar and consequently lead to a large value of $CL_{s}$, telling us the signal is **not** excluded. In case our observations are exactly on spot with the background expectations $P(q_{obs}|b) = 0.5$ in the asymptotic limit, so on average we have twice as high \"p-values\" with $CL_s$.\n",
    "\n",
